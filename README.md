## Introduction

The Thawpal project's microcontroller serves as the device's central processing unit, responsible for orchestrating various operations, including valve and pump control, sensor data analysis, and cloud synchronization. Developed with a vision of energy efficiency, adaptability, and user-centric design, this documentation offers insights into the microcontroller's architecture, functionalities, and operational modes.

## ESP32 Platform

The microcontroller operates on the ESP32 platform, chosen for its:

- Robust software support and extensive libraries.
- Affordability and built-in connectivity options.
- Energy-efficient deep sleep capability, minimizing power consumption to micro-Watt levels.

## Control Loop Overview

The device's control loop comprises the following sequence of operations:

### Wake Up from Deep Sleep

- Activates the device from deep sleep mode, optimizing energy efficiency.

### Monitor Water and Salt Levels

- Continuously monitors water and salt levels in the tank, initiating refilling and brine generation cycles as required.
- Alerts users if salt levels deviate from the desired concentration.

### Synchronize Data with Cloud

- Facilitates seamless synchronization with the ThawPal cloud database, ensuring real-time data accessibility and updates.

### Time Synchronization

- Synchronizes with internet-based time services to maintain accurate timekeeping and scheduling functionalities.

### Retrieve Operation Mode

- Retrieves the user-selected operation mode from the cloud interface, informing subsequent actions and functionalities.

### Execute Mode-Specific Actions

- Executes mode-specific actions based on user preferences, adjusting pump control variables and operational parameters accordingly.

### Spraying Control

- Initiates spraying cycles based on predefined conditions and operational modes, ensuring effective and timely operation.

### Return to Deep Sleep

- Re-enters deep sleep mode upon completing the control loop, conserving energy until the next operational cycle.
